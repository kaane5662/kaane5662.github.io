            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>Our teacher assigned us this project so we can combine our learning of github/ide and markdown into 1. This project mainly helped me learned how to resolve merge conflicts or initiate automatic merge since this project was done with multiple collaborators. In addition, this project also helped me learned the concept of markdown since the whole project was supposed to be written in markdown. </p>
          <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>I have faced multiple challenges in this project. First of all not being able to use any command associated with the word git in the command line. I fixed this by cd-ing to the directory I cloned so it can say main/master. Another challenge I faced was not being able to link the readme file destinations correctly, I fixed this by using .. to go up a directory, then wrote the directory name, and finally writing the readme file name(../amazon/shopping.md). The third challenge was having the inability to push my commits since I am "behind the master branch". I fixed this using git pull which then leads to my second challenge of this part which was automatic merges and merge conflicts. For automatic merge I just git add., git commit -m "", and git push to fix, same for merge conflicts but I have to get rid of the numbers the dashes and the head thing. The fourth challenge was me commiting and the comandline responding with "branch clean nothing to commit". I realized that I have forgot to add my work to the snapshot so I fixed it by git add . as well as checking if it's green on git status. Then I recommit and it works.  </p>
          <h2>Next Steps</h2>
          <p>If I come back to this project, I would probably add pictures for design as well as maybe add some line's using --- to seperate the text from the title. Also maybe make my good ending in green text and bad ending in red text.
